Usage: lock-versions [file(s)...]

  Locks all of your package.json's versions to a single version number,
  matching the best version currently available on npm that satisfies the
  current range.

  Useful mostly for providing more reliable deploys when running node
  applications in production. For example:

  lock-versions package.json
  lock-versions node_modules/*/package.json
  cat package.json | lock-versions > package.json
